 * @{sample_freq_in_matches}      Total frequency of unique clonotypes in the sample that have at least one match
 * @{mean_matched_clone_size}     Geometric mean of frequency of unique clonotypes in the sample that have at least one match

 * Using this class one can also iterate over the list of matches
